## 20250415

I realised that I am all over the place, jumping in an out, ebbing and flowing. Although it is alright to have a bit of chaos, I looked around and realised that I am not going deep enough to have that sense of understanding to scare away my imposter syndrome. So I looked around and found this site called learncpp.com which covers all the topics in depth, really and the downside being I will be a bit more slower. I guess it is much preferrable to a whale and gulp my Krill slow and get awesome in a consistent manner rather than feeding my already substratial mental drag

So I will be using a hybrid method rather than going EV only (brr.. )

I have also decided against using AI tools being active parter and have decided to relegate them to being passive partners, like a mentor, guiding me to solve issues only when needed, else it is going to etch away on my muscle memory

I am using VS Studio Community after a long time and will be using it to get the muscle memory to be where my Python Muscle Memory now. Feels like going to the Gym because it feels deliberate, and it is ofcourse deliberate. I am in no way a born genius, perhaps an Ironman without the Bilionaire Philanthropy shenanigans but with matching passion!

Live Long and Prosper!<br>

Feeling like a novice is a feeling that I hate the most, but one I must endure. I have started, restarted, pivoted, adjusted my strategy and finally have a feeling that I have the right source material with learncpp.com. I am also taking up my notes in Obsidian and using Dataview plugin to pull all my notes together. Some times, just going through the notes, I realize that the barrier is my brain itself. I am wondering how much more could I have learned if I assured myself I could do this before and was not impossible, although difficult. I must also manage the use of generative tools and use it wisely so that It does not hinder my ability to learn and stretch my ability rather than stifle it.

Not sure what I am aiming for all this efforts though, although I must say that it feels good to learn an expand my thinking and thought process itself

So Project Teletrack Sim is my struggle and tribulations in understanding my new assignment and final frontier of programming languages as far as I am concerned, C++. I am doing this as a project to get two birds with one stone: Understanding the Project I am working on as a new Embedded Engineer and Face off with the long dreaded C++ and conquer it.

While at it, I want to do it in style and follow industry standards. So I am using the following:

1. CMake as the build tool
2. Conan for dependency Managment
3. GTest for Unit Testing Management

There will be CI and even CD coming up soon and there will be more to come. Hopefully there is something to the deliberate practice that I have believed in my entire adult life

Live Long and Prosper<br>
