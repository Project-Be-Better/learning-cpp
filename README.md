## 20250415

I realised that I am all over the place, jumping in an out, ebbing and flowing. Although it is alright to have a bit of chaos, I looked around and realised that I am not going deep enough to have that sense of understanding to scare away my imposter syndrome. So I looked around and found this site called learncpp.com which covers all the topics in depth, really and the downside being I will be a bit more slower. I guess it is much preferrable to a whale and gulp my Krill slow and get awesome in a consistent manner rather than feeding my already substratial mental drag

So I will be using a hybrid method rather than going EV only (brr.. )

I have also decided against using AI tools being active parter and have decided to relegate them to being passive partners, like a mentor, guiding me to solve issues only when needed, else it is going to etch away on my muscle memory

I am using VS Studio Community after a long time and will be using it to get the muscle memory to be where my Python Muscle Memory now. Feels like going to the Gym because it feels deliberate, and it is ofcourse deliberate. I am in no way a born genius, perhaps an Ironman without the Bilionaire Philanthropy shenanigans but with matching passion!

Live Long and Prosper!
