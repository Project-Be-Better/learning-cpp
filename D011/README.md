## Note

I am using VS Studio Community after a long time and will be using it to get the muscle memory to be where my Python Muscle Memory now. Feels like going to the Gym because it feels deliberate, and it is ofcourse deliberate. I am in no way a born genius, perhaps an Ironman without the Bilionaire Philanthropy but with matching passion! Live Long and Prosper!
