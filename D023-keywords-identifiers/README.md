| -------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| [[camelCase]]  | camelCase, can be used for functions and variables or both  |
| [[snake_case]] | snake_case, can be used for functions and variables or both |
|                |                                                             |

#### Note

- use [[camelCase]] or [[snake_case]] for functions
- Do not use the reserved keywords in C++
- It cannot have space in between and must start with a letter or an underscore
- Identifier names that start with a capital letter are typically used for user-defined types
- underScored identifiers should not be defined in a global scope
