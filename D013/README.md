| [[Program]]                                             | A computer program is a sequence of instructions that tell the computer what to do                                                                                                |
| [[Statement]]                                           | A statement is a type of instruction that causes the program to perform some action                                                                                               |
| [[Function]]                                            | A function is a collection of statements that get executed sequentially (in order, from top to bottom)                                                                            |
| [[Identifier]]                                          | In programming, the name of a function (or object, type, template, etc…) is called its identifier                                                                                 |
| [[Preprocessor]]                                        | A tool that runs before the actual compilation starts                                                                                                                             |
| [[Syntax]]                                              | The set of rules that describe how specific words (and punctuation) can be arranged to form valid sentences in a language                                                         |
| [[Comments]]                                            | A comment is a programmer-readable note that is inserted directly into the source code of the program. Comments are ignored by the compiler and are for the programmer’s use only |
| [[Comments#Single Line Comments\|Single Line Comments]] | Typically, the single-line comment is used to make a quick comment about a single line of code                                                                                    |
| [[Comments#Multi Line Comments\|Multi Line Comments]]   | Mainly done for documentation                                                                                                                                                     |
