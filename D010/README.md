| [[C]]                                     | Developed by [[Dennis Ritchie]]<br><br>Most of the Unix Operating System was rewritten using C in 1973<br><br>C99 released in 1999  |      |
| [[⚓ C++\|C++]]                            | Developed by [[Bjarne Stroustrup]] at [[Bell Telephone Laboratories]]<br><br>Superset of [[C]]<br><br>Major innovation is that it supports [[⚓ Object Oriented Principles\|OOP]]<br><br>Standardized in 1998<br><br> |      |
| [[The C Programming Language]]            | [[Brian Kernighan]] and [[Dennis Ritchie]] in 1978<br><br>De facto standard for C Programming |      |
| [[Bug]]                                      | Any programming Error that prevents the program from working correctly <br><br>The term _bug_ was first used by Thomas Edison back in the 1870s! However, the term was popularized in the 1940s when engineers found an actual moth stuck in the hardware of an early computer, causing a short circuit. Both the log book in which the error was reported and the moth are now part of the Smithsonian Museum of American History. It can be viewed [here](https://americanhistory.si.edu/collections/nmah_334663)<br><br>Only 10 to 40% of time is spent on writing the initial program and the remaining time is spent on maintenance like debugging |
| Tools to be used                             | [Coding Font](https://www.codingfont.com/) and [Programming Fonts](https://www.programmingfonts.org/) both have neat tools that allow you to compare different coding fonts to see which ones you like best.|
|Best Practice|Name the first/primary source code file in each program main.cpp. This makes it easy to determine which source code file is the primary one.|
