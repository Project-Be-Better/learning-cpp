> Literals are values that are inserted directly into the source code. These values usually appear directly in the executable code (unless they are optimized out).
>
> Objects and variables represent memory locations that hold values. These values can be fetched on demand.

| [[Literals]] <br>or <br>[[Literals\|Literal Constant]] | A fixed value that has been inserted directly into the source code<br><br>Literal has a value and type, but the value of the literal cannot be changed<br><br>A literal’s value is placed directly in the executable, and the executable itself can’t be changed after it is created |
| [[Operation]]                                          | A process involving zero or more input values (called operands) that produces a new value (called an output value). The specific operation to be performed is denoted by a symbol called an operator                                                                                 |
| [[arity]]                                              | The number of operands that an operator takes as input is called the operator’s arity                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| [[Unary Operator]]                                     | Unary operators act on one operand                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

| [[Ternary Operator]]                                   | Ternary operators act on three operands                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
